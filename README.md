# save-manager

Allows for quick and easy save management for literally anything.

## reason for existing

I wanna save-scum in a video game becuase I can't beat a boss (terraria,
plantera on master mode zenith seed for anyone interested). What this allows
me to do is to make dated and named (or not if I dont' wanna) backups of world/
player files. It also doubles as a pretty decent first rust project. If you're
a job seeing this, please give me a job.

## how to use:

It has a pretty extensive help system generated by clap so if you just run
`save-manager --help` it should be pretty exhaustive.

## real life example

Here you can see I get a bunch of stuff I don't like from the boss drops, so I
just type `save-manager load` and it just restores me back to right before I
opened the bags. I do it again and immediately get the stuff I want. The whole
goal of the project is for it to be as simple as typing `save-manager load` and
it immediately resetting from there.

TODO:
- [X] allow for multiple paths in one save
- [ ] better error handling for filesystem calls
- [X] REALLY IMPORTANT disallow multiple saves of the same name
