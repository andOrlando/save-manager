## save-manager

Allows for quick and easy save management for literally anything.

# reason for existing

I wanna save-scum in a video game becuase I can't beat a boss (terraria,
plantera on master mode zenith seed for anyone interested). What this allows
me to do is to make dated and named (or not if I dont' wanna) backups of world/
player files. It also doubles as a pretty decent first rust project. If you're
a job seeing this, please give me a job.

TODO:
- [ ] allow for multiple paths in one save
- [ ] better error handling for filesystem calls
